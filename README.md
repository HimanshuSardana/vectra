# üß† Vectra

Vectra is a lightweight terminal-based interface for managing vector stores ‚Äî starting with ChromaDB, with plans to support other backends. It helps you create, query, and organize collections of embedded documents through an intuitive TUI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- üîç Query documents via semantic similarity
- üóÇÔ∏è Create, list, and delete collections
- üìÑ View stored documents
- üì¶ Powered by ChromaDB with pluggable vector DB support (soon)
- üé® Rich-powered interface with sleek panels
- ü§ñ Easy to integrate into other Python tools (e.g., web frameworks)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vectra.git
cd vectra
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

> Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and `chromadb` installed.

### Running

```bash
python main.py
```

You‚Äôll be greeted with an interactive interface where you can create collections, add/query documents, and manage your vector DB.

## üó∫ Roadmap

Here's what we plan to build next:

* [x] Basic TUI structure with Rich
* [x] Integration with ChromaDB
* [x] Collection creation/deletion/listing
* [x] Basic querying via CLI
* [x] Panel-based layout with Rich
* [ ] Add document support (with metadata)
* [ ] Multi-result querying
* [ ] Pluggable embedder support (`sentence-transformers`, OpenAI, Cohere, etc.)
* [ ] Multiple vector DB backends (Qdrant, Weaviate)
* [ ] Export/import collections
* [ ] Search history
* [ ] Optional CLI (non-TUI) interface
* [ ] Optional web mode via FastAPI wrapper
* [ ] PyPI release (`pip install vectra`)

## üß© Possible Use Cases

* Quickly inspect and manage embeddings without needing a full UI
* Test vector search before deploying RAG pipelines
* Integrate into custom Python-based frameworks
* Build tools for your team or research group
